        <p>Hello! My name is Olivia Kahn, and this is my portfolio. Here is a picture of me:</p>
        <img src= "Olivia Kahn-Picture.JPG" alt= "Olivia Kahn">
        <p>I'm not really sure what to put in the portfolio yet, so I am going to practice adding code, and maybe get an outline.</p>
        <h2>Section 1</h2>
        <p>This is the first section of my portfolio, where I will have information about:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Something</li>
            <li>Something else</li>
            <li>Something else</li>
        </ol>
